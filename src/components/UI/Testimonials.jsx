                  I knew I was in for some serious workouts when Mitch (Head
                  trainer) pushed me as hard as Iâ€™d been in 5 years on the first
                  day. Always with a smile but more importantly an awareness of
                  my abilities Mitch and team are the reason I am coming back to
                  train again. Want to push yourself with great people then this
                  is the place. Big shout to Mitch Fry he helped me find new
                  limits. Keep up the great work!
